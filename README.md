# Administrator Management of Money
This is a web application for managing finances, built with Python and Flask for the backend, and Bootstrap, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for the frontend. The database is implemented with MySQL, using relationships between tables with one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

## Getting Started
To use this application, you can clone the repository and run the following commands to set up the environment:

`docker-compose up --build`


This will create the database and download the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Usage
Once you have the environment set up, you can navigate to the application in your web browser and start managing your finances. Features include adding transactions, tracking expenses, setting budgets, and viewing reports.
